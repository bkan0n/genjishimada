# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-29)

**Core value:** Give the Genji Parkour community a persistent, competitive cycle that keeps players engaged week-over-week through fresh map challenges, leaderboard competition, and visible champion recognition.
**Current focus:** Phase 05 — Map Selection & Blacklist

## Current Position

Phase: 05 (Map Selection & Blacklist) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-05-30

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 10 phases derived from 25 requirements with fine granularity, horizontal layer approach splitting schema/SDK/repository into separate foundational phases
- [Roadmap]: Phases 1-3 are foundational (no direct requirement mapping), Phases 4-10 map all 25 v1 requirements
- [Phase ?]: All 4 tournament RabbitMQ event types defined upfront in SDK to prevent churn across phases 3-10
- [Phase ?]: JSONB columns modeled as typed sub-structs (PlacementXpTier, StreakXpTier) for compile-time validation
- [Phase ?]: Used aliased barrel import (TournamentsCategoryNotFoundError) matching existing CompletionsMapNotFoundError convention
- [Phase 05]: Conditional SQL query building pattern for optional exclude_map_ids in fetch_eligible_maps
- [Phase 05]: Used re.sub difficulty normalization for choose_map validation, matching SQL regexp_replace pattern
- [Phase 05]: choose_map silently replaces existing pending cycle rather than requiring explicit reroll first

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: Phase 6 (Submission + Cross-Write) needs careful study of the `enforce_speed_rules_nonlegacy_only()` trigger behavior
- Research flag: Phase 7 (Cycle Transitions) outbox bridge pattern is architecturally novel for this codebase -- needs validation during planning
- Verification tier mapping: existing completions use boolean `verified` + `video` presence, tournament needs integer tiers -- resolve during Phase 1 schema design

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Test bug | `TestCheckActiveCycleForCategory` asserts `is True`/`is False` but method returns `int \| None` (phase 03-02, commit 99623a3) | open | Phase 05 P03 |
